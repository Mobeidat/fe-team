### Local State vs Global State

> Try to get as far as possible with the built-in state management solutions
> I recommend trying to avoid global state where you can
> Debugging react components is nice. You only have to take into account the props and the local state. Local state is only managed by the component itself and the props are managed by the parent component. It's not hard to keep track of those. As soon as you introduce one ore more contexts it gets harder to keep track of changes or possible changes because the context can be altered from anywhere.
